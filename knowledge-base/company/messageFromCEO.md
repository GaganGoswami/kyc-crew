# A Message from Our CEO

**To Our Clients, Partners, and Team,**  

When I founded Aurora Peak in 2008, the financial world was in upheaval. Traditional models had failed, and trust in institutions was shattered. I saw an opportunity to build something different—a firm where **technology and humanity coexist** to create lasting value.  

Over the past 15 years, we’ve stayed true to that vision. Whether it’s deploying AI to predict market shifts or committing 10% of profits to green energy funds, we measure success by the impact we deliver.  

### Looking Ahead
- **Expanding Access**: Launching APAM’s **Digital Wealth Platform** in 2024 to serve retail investors.  
- **Climate Pledge**: Achieving net-zero operations by 2030.  
- **Talent Revolution**: Doubling our Asia-Pacific workforce to support emerging markets.  

None of this would be possible without the dedication of our global team and the trust of our clients. As we scale new peaks together, I remain humbled by the responsibility you’ve placed in us.
